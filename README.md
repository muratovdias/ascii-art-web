# ASCII-ART-WEB

## Objectives


Ascii-art-web is a program whose purpose is to create and run a server on which the web version of the Ascii-art program can be used. 

Ascii-art is a program which consists in receiving a `string` as an argument and outputting the `string` in a graphic representation using ASCII.

What we mean by a graphic representation using ASCII, is to write the `string` received using ASCII characters, as you can see in the example below:

```````````console
_|                _| _|                                                     _|       _| 
_|_|_|     _|_|   _| _|   _|_|         _|      _|      _|   _|_|   _|  _|_| _|   _|_|_| 
_|    _| _|_|_|_| _| _| _|    _|       _|      _|      _| _|    _| _|_|     _| _|    _| 
_|    _| _|       _| _| _|    _|         _|  _|  _|  _|   _|    _| _|       _| _|    _| 
_|    _|   _|_|_| _| _|   _|_|             _|      _|       _|_|   _|       _|   _|_|_|

Basic requirements:
- You must use your ascii-art application for this project.
- You can run your server locally (localhost) or using an API.
- You must use the different banners for the website.
- It should be available to choose between the banners.
- You have to use the right HTTP methods.

- Back-end and front-end.
- The basics of web :
  - Server

  - HTTP
  - HTTP methods
  - HTTP status
- Ways to receive data
- Ways to output data

Instructions
- You must handle website errors(400, 404 and 500).
- The web server must be created in Go.
- The code must respect the good practices.
- The project must have files written in HTML and CSS.


#### The program is launched in the following order:

> go run main.go

After launching the program, a notification will be issued that the server has started. For further work, follow the link provided on the console:


```````````console
